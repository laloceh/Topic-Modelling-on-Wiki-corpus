article = "Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi[14] was born on 2 October 1869[1] to a \
            Hindu Modh Baniya family[15] in Porbandar (also known as Sudamapuri)\
            , a coastal town on the Kathiawar Peninsula and then part of the \
            small princely state of Porbandar in the Kathiawar Agency of the \
            Indian Empire. His father, Karamchand Uttamchand Gandhi (1822–1885), \
            served as the diwan (chief minister) of Porbandar state.[16] Although\
            he only had an elementary education and had previously been a clerk \
            in the state administration, Karamchand proved a capable chief minister.[17] \
            During his tenure, Karamchand married four times. His first two wives \
            died young, after each had given birth to a daughter, and his third\
            marriage was childless. In 1857, Karamchand sought his third wife's\
            permission to remarry; that year, he married Putlibai (1844–1891), \
            who also came from Junagadh,[18] and was from a Pranami Vaishnava \
            family.[19][20][21][22] Karamchand and Putlibai had three children \
            over the ensuing decade, a son, Laxmidas (c. 1860 – March 1914), a \
            daughter, Raliatbehn (1862–1960) and another son, Karsandas (c. 1866–1913)"
